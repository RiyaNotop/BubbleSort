Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm, that is, a recipe for a computer to put a list in order. As it runs, the larger elements bubble up to the top, and the smaller elements sink to the bottom, hence the name.

It’s not very fast, so it’s not used much, but it is simple to write.

Suppose we have the following list of integers:

[4, 2, 5, 1, 3]

We’ll make several passes in which we move along our list. Each time, if we see a larger element below a smaller element, we swap them.

So first we compare 4 and 2. 4 is larger, so we swap them, and the list becomes:

[2, 4, 5, 1, 3]

Then we compare 4 and 5. 5 is larger, so we do nothing.

Next we compare 5 and 1, swap them, then compare 5 and 3, and swap again. After the first pass, our list is:

[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

We’ve succeeded at putting the largest element in the highest position. So now we start over again from the beginning.

After each pass, at least one more element will be in the correct position at the end of the array, until the entire list is sorted.

Feel free to try coding the rules for this in your favorite programming language. But don’t try to run it on very large lists (say, a million elements) - it will take far too long.
